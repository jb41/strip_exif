System to strip exif data from images. I should be able to upload an image, have the exif data stripped, and download a clean version of the same file.
Take a look at this JS implementation. https://github.com/codepo8/image-data-cleaner/ and see if it can fit the requirements.
Please also show a working iteration without this library.
